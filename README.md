Surviving Mars Mods

This is a repository of my mods for [Surviving Mars](http://store.steampowered.com/app/464920/Surviving_Mars/).

# Mods

## AutoCargo

RC Transports automatically move resources between storage depots.

### Disclaimer:
The algorithm is very basic and just a proof of concept I plan to keep refining. It just tries to even out the quantities accross all depots. 

I asked the devs for help to understand how drones/shuttles know where to move cargo but I didn't get a reply so I guess I am sort of reinventing the wheel here :-(

### TODO:

- Improve the algorithm
- Add some sort of alert
- Configurable task interval (right now it checks every game-hour)

# Planned mods (feel free to steal these ideas from me :-)

## Rover AutoShelter

Rovers automatically run away from Meteors, dust devils and seek shelter away from meteor storms.

## Locked storage depots

A new set of storage depots with a "padlock" which disallows taking resources from them while active. (Idea for mod I saw suggested by https://www.twitch.tv/charliepryor)
